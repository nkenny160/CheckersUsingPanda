# CheckersUsingPanda
This was a final project for ELEN 131 at SCU by Tyler Costello, Nicholas Kenny, and Aidan O'hare to develop an MoveIt environment 
powered by Rviz for two players to play checkers using a Franka Emika Panda Robot. The robot was programmed using Python and ROS framework. 
Currently it uses a tf2 path planning algorithm, but we want to change this soon. The game and simulation are run through the terminal interface for now.
Everything needed to play the game (including setup and game logic) is contained within the checkers_model file. Instructions will be posted soon.

For now, you can view a demo of our project at the following links: <br>
